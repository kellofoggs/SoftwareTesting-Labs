SENG275 Lab 01 feedback

Your mark: 2/2

Lab01 is worth 2% of your final grade.  To receive this mark, you must have EITHER:

- attempted to add some code to ArrayUtilsTest.java - it doesn't really matter if it 
  worked or not; you get the mark if you at least tried.  AND
- pushed your changes back to the gitlab repository

OR

- submitted your code to me by email, teams, or any other method

OR

- if you were having technical problems, you communicated with us about them in ANY WAY
  prior to the due date.

If you submitted no new code, and didn't let us know you were having problems, you got a zero.

Future labs will be marked based on whether your code works and accomplishes the goal of the
exercises, of course.
