Which standards tool did you use?

I used Google lighthouse for the BrightSpace main page test.



Name any one test that passed, and describe why that test is important, in your own words.
What would be the problem if the test had failed?

The accessibility test passed. Namely, the linked texts had discernible and unique names. This allows
for easier navigation for screen read users. Had this test not passed those who use screen reader
(i.e. the visually impaired or people who struggle to read would be unable to efficiently use the site.




Name any one test that failed (yellow or red) and explain why the failed test suggest
there's a problem with the website.  Who is it a problem for?  What kinds of obstacles
could this issue present?

The performance tests failed with a score of 55. This type of failure effects all users of the website as
it means that it takes a main page user a longer time to accomplish whatever they are on the site for. An issue found by the test
is that many JavaScript scripts and loading scripts were not required at all times but still contributed to
network activity traffic.
