Summary of bug:
The program says that a license plate for a non motorcycle is valid if it has 7 characters and no hyphen

Expected behaviour:
Validate the message for a license plate, in this case say a 7-character message without a hyphen is invalid

Actual behaviour: Claims a 7-character message w/o a hyphen is valid

Steps to Reproduce:
Choose a license plate message with 7 valid letters and/or digits for a non motorcycle. Make sure to not put any hyphens


Severity: Very severe, breaks the rules of the test
